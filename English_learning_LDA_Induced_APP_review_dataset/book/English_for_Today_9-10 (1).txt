Preface
The secondary curriculum has been revised in the light of National Education Policy
2010, which emphasises learning English as an intarntional language for
communicating locally and globally. The English For Today textbooks have been
developed to help students attain competency in all four language skills, i.e. listening,
speaking, reading and writing.
The development of curriculum, syllabus and textbook is a continuous process. In
continuation of it, this book has been developed and rationally evaluated by a group
of experts, which included curriculum specialists, subject specialists, teacher trainers
and classroom teachers. The contents and illustrations of this book have been
developed in order to suit the learners' age and cognitive level. The book emphasises
practising language skills through a variety of meaningful and enjoyable activities.
The publication of teacher's guide is under process. The teacher's guide will help
teachers plan lessons more effectively and teach students communicatively through
teaching learning activities.
My heartfelt gratitude goes to the curriculum developers, writers, illustrators and
coordinator who worked under tremendous time constraints. Without their sincerity,
commitment and hard work, it would not have been possible for NCTB to develop the
English textbook 'English For Today', making it available to teachers and students all
over the country by January 2013. As the textbook was developed within a very
limited time, there is room for further development. Attempts have been made to
make the book free from errors as far as possible. Any constructive suggestions for
the improvement of the textbook will be welcomed and incorporated in future
editions.
I also sincerely thank all involved in the production and publication of this textbook.
If this book is used properly, it will no doubt facilitate learning English at the desired
level.

Read the story and answer the questions that follow.

Long ago, a young man found life in the family in his village full of problems and
sufferings. Quarrels, ill-feelings, jealously, enmity - all were part of everyday life
there.
So he left his house and went to a jungle to live by himself. There he made a nice
little hut with wood, bamboo and reeds. “Ah, how happy I am here!” said the man to
himself.
But one day he found some mice in his hut. The little creatures soon made holes in
his blanket. So he brought a cat to kill the mice. The cat needed milk. So he brought a
cow. The cow needed grass and hay. So he brought a cowboy.

English For Today

The cowboy needed food. So he took a wife to cook meals. Then children were born
to them, and the man found himself again in a family.
So nobody can live alone, unless they are either angels or devils. People need food,
shelter, companions and cooperation. They need to help each other. And if they live
in a family or community, their need can be fulfilled. Hence living in society can
make people good and happy citizens.

As people live in a community or society, they often have problems. A
family may have a problem with a particular member (a son / daughter) who
keeps bad company. So they discuss to solve the problem.

2

To prevent theft or robberies, constant security measures are often
necessary within the village / city area.

3

A community may have a problem like they don’t have a primary school in
the village or locality. So the people need to discuss the issue in a meeting
and find out how to set up a school for their children.

4

F

Cooking should not be exclusively a woman’s job.

5

Young learners must cultivate virtues and acquire knowledge and skills to
prepare themselves to carry out their roles as good citizens. So they need to
study formally in the institutions.

6

To establish peace and harmony among the people in a locality / village,
often experienced, elderly people mediate between quarrelling people.

7

Only studying at school is not enough for the young learners. They must
also acquire knowledge and skills at home as well as from media, clubs,
sports, libraries and so on.

8

The people in a society / locality often need to buy things at home. So
there are vendors selling necessary things.

9

In a village or locality often roads need reservicing for easy movement of
people and transport.

10

Side by side with acquiring knowledge and skills, the youths must cultivate
good qualities like having genuine sympathy for the weak and the poor,
helping the needy, showing respect for others and having a strong sense of
dignity of work.

Discuss in pairs and write an answer to this question:
What can we do at home and in the locality to become good citizens?

Lesson 2: Knowledge, skills and attitudes
A

Discuss in groups this question:
What do you need in addition to food, shelter, company, etc. to become a
good citizen?

B

Read the text.

To be a good citizen, you have to prepare yourself to do good work in society. Well,
then how can you prepare yourself?
First, you need knowledge. Today’s society is knowledge-based. Without knowing
modern sciences, technologies including ICT and other necessary subjects, you will
have difficulty living a good life. The other areas you, as a good citizen, should have
knowledge about are:
x our country, its constitution, geography and people
x our state, its executive and legislative powers
x our judicial system
x our government and its structures and functions
x our history, cultures, traditions, literature, moral values and religions
x our socio-economic activities and educational system
Second, you need skills to do things. Knowledge is not enough. You must be able to
apply your knowledge to do things practically.
Finally, knowing and doing things will bring about a change in your behaviour
towards others. This behavioural change will show your attitudes towards others, that
is, it will show how you think and feel about a person or thing.



English For Today

Let’s take an example. Suppose you, as a student, need to know about ‘group work’
in the classroom. So you ask yourself or your teacher or anybody, “What is group
work?” Or you may find about it in a book. In this way, you can know, or you may
have the knowledge, about group work: To do group work, the class has to be
divided into groups. Each group is to do some tasks given by the teacher or in the
textbook. The group members will discuss and share ideas and points, and finally one
member will write the answer. All this is knowledge about group work.
Then you start working in groups. In each group you take turns discussing points,
answering questions, etc. In this way you actually do the task. Your teacher may
monitor and help you to do the work.
Lastly, through regular group work it is expected that there will be noticeable
changes in your behaviour. Possible changes are:
x You will develop the attitude of freely mixing and talking with your
classmates and teacher.
x Your shyness will gradually disappear.
x You will develop the attitude of helping and cooperating with each
other.
x You will learn to behave in a democratic way.
Most importantly, these behavioural changes taking place in you inside the classroom
will be carried over outside the classroom, in real-life situations.

Read the text below. Then discuss with your partner and write K (if the
text is knowledge based) or S (if the text is skill based) or A (if the text
refers to attitude) against each text.

Lesson 4: Responsibilities
A

Read the situation.

Rony’s mother gave him 50 taka to buy salt and chillies. On his way to the market,
Rony found a poor passer-by trying to hold a boy up, who was lying on the road,
groaning. Coming near, Rony saw that it was his classmate Tanim, who was hit by a
speeding motorbike. Immediately he called a baby taxi and took Tanim to a clinic.
From there he phoned Tanim’s parents. When they came to the clinic, Rony returned
home without salt and chillies. He paid the money to the taxi driver.
Now discuss in groups the following questions.
1

Did Rony do right or wrong? Why ?

2

What do you think his mother will do when Rony comes back home
without salt and chillies?

B

What do you mean by responsibility?

Read the text and answer the following question:
What is responsibility?

A responsibility is a duty or an obligation TO DO something. For example, you have
the responsibility to take care of your parents in their old age, to attend school and
pursue your studies properly and so on. You have also the responsibility to society
and the government, e.g. to help a neighbour in trouble or to cast your vote if you are
18 or over.
A responsibility is also an obligation or a duty NOT TO DO something. For example,
you have the responsibility not to steal a book from a public library or not to put your
building materials on the footpath. These are your responsibilities as citizens. But


English For Today

13

there are responsibilities of the government as well. Our government has the
responsibilities to provide for its citizens “the basic necessities of life, including food,
clothing, shelter, education and medical care”1. The government also has the
responsibilities to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens to freedom of speech
and expression, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, equality of all before law2
etc.
The knowledge, skills and attitudes you have gained at home, at school and in society
will help you to accept your responsibilities and to carry them out effectively.
Remember, discharging your responsibilities will be good for you, good for your
family and friends, and good for your society and country as a whole.

Understanding yoga
Yoga is a kind of posture and breathing exercises. It brings together physical and
mental disciplines to achieve peace of body and mind, helping you relax and manage
stress and anxiety. Traditional yoga puts emphasis on behavior, diet and meditation.
But if you're just looking for better stress management— and not an entire lifestyle

activities for practitioners. However, all practitioners do not necessarily need the
same kinds of practice.
The health benefits of yoga
The potential health benefits of yoga are numerous and may include:
x

Stress reduction. With its quiet, precise movements, yoga draws your focus
away from your busy, chaotic day and towards calm as you move your body
through poses that require balance and concentration.

x

Increased fitness. As you learn and refine new poses, you may enjoy
improved balance, flexibility, range of motion and strength. And this means
you're less likely to injure yourself in other physical endeavors or in your daily
activities.

x

Management of chronic health conditions. Yoga might help with a variety
of health conditions, such as cancer, depression, pain, anxiety and insomnia,
fatigue and mood. Yoga can also help reduce heart rate and blood pressure.

x

Weight loss. If you're overweight or have eating disorder, yoga may help you
make the healthy lifestyle changes necessary to gain control of your eating and
drop those extra pounds.

While you shouldn't expect yoga to cure you or offer you relief 100 percent, it can
help some health conditions when combined with standard treatment. And if you
already enjoy good health, yoga can be an enjoyable supplement to your regular
fitness routine.

The Olympics have many memorable moments and athletes we'll remember by name
alone. The list is quite big. Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt are the latest addition to
this list of the bests. They make London Olympics stand apart. If there is any
question like this: “What is the standout performance of London 2012?”, perhaps the
answer is “ The London Games gave us Michael Phelps vs. Usain Bolt.” The first
one is an already decorated Olympian, who puts the finishing touches on his great
athletic careers. And another comes up with a new definition of fast.
Two of the most popular Olympic sports, sprinting and swimming, saw their two
biggest stars and captivated audiences. They'd also dominated the 2008 Beijing
Games, but Phelps and Bolt cemented their legacies in London. Phelps, the American
swimmer, passed gymnast Larissa Latynia for the most Olympic medals ever. Bolt
was the third man to repeat as a 100-meter gold medalist and the first as a 200-meter
gold medalist, and he broke his own Olympic record by running the 100 in 9.63
seconds. Once Phelps and Bolt were back in their pool and track, the story lines
changed.



English For Today

23

Phelps is the most-decorated Olympian ever, with 22 overall medals: 18 gold, two
silver, two bronze. Bolt is the most accomplished Olympic sprinter, with the
unprecedented double, making clear that he's the fastest man in the world.
But there's a debate: Who had the better Olympics? It'd be tough to top Phelps' eight
gold medals in Beijing, but what if we're only talking London?
London was Phelps' grand finale. He won four golds and two silvers in seven events,
and he says he'll never race again.
London was Bolt's chance to prove he's still the greatest. Bolt wins six gold medals in
six Olympic finals. He is the first man ever in the history of the modern Games to
sweep the 100 and 200 in back-to-back Olympics. Not to mention the addition of
back-to-back relay golds.
And Bolt became a legend, in his own words. Phelps already was. Bolt is just 25
years old, so there is no telling how long he can be on top of the sprinting world.
What if he decides to "retire" from sprinting to focus on the 400 meters, just to break
another world record or two? It would be amazing—and entirely plausible for him to
accomplish.

Childhood outdoor pastimes 'in decline'
Traditional childhood pastimes of climbing trees and playing conkers are in decline,
according to survey by the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). It’s a
charitable organisation registered in England and Wales.
The survey shows that people under 34 recall far fewer such childhood outdoor
experiences than their counterparts over 55, according to a survey by RSPB.
People were asked which of 12 outdoor experiences they could remember during
their childhood. The answer included making dens, daisy chains, climbing trees,
playing conkers and feeding birds. Four out of five boys climbed trees and the same
number of girls made daisy chains. But the survey showed the numbers declining
among the newer generations.
Some 15% more of those aged over 55 had
these outdoor experiences in their childhood,
compared with those between 15-34 years old.
Some

92%

of

the

public

agreed

that

experiences of nature were still important to
children, and 82% agreed that schools should
play a role in providing them to all children.



26

English For Today

The survey has highlighted the positive impact of contact with nature on a child's
education, health, wellbeing and social skills. At the same time, there has been a
decline in these opportunities, with negative consequences for children, families and
society - a condition now known as nature deficit disorder.
Mike Clarke, chief executive of the RSPB, will meet parliament members on
Tuesday to urge the government to join other organisations in providing children
with first-hand experiences of the natural environment. … "We believe this guidance
should include the many positive impacts to children of having contact with nature
and learning outside the classroom."

Tiya: Hello everyone! My name is Tiya. My friend, Anusha and I are going to do a
presentation on Pastime Habits of Classes 9 and 10 students in our school. There are
120 students, 60 in class 9 and 60 in class 10. The classes have gender equity. Each
class has 30 male and 30 female students. The survey shows that 22.3 percent of
students in classes 9-10 like games and sports as their most favourite pastime, which
is the 4th option given by classes 5-6 students. Watching television is the second
choice (17.2%) by the first group in contrast to 31.2% of the second group. It is
noteworthy that watching television is the first choice of the second group. A
considerable number (13.7%) of 9-10 students like to chat with their friends and thus
it becomes the third popular choice in the graph while this becomes one of the less
important choices by the younger kids. Only 6.7% of the kids take it as their first
priority. It’s interesting that both the groups like reading books. 12.9% of students of
classes 9-10 take it as their favourite pastime. The number is 11.7% for 5-6 students.
Besides, gardening is voted (10.7% of students) to be the 5th preference by the grown
up group though it is not that much liked by the younger group. Only 6.1% of the
young kids are involved in it. This is interesting that though higher number of
students in classes 9-10 prefer attending social programs (9.1%) than students of
classes 5-6 (7.8%), yet as a choice it is preferred by the later group. It is the 5th choice
for them while to the older group it is the 6th. Young kids have greater fascination for
playing games on the computers (20.9% of learners like it as their first choice). The
graph shows that as the kids grow up, they lose their passion for computer games.
According to the graph the ratio declines to 8.2% from 20.9% when the kids are
students of classes 9-10. Finally, it can be said that the influence of television has
impact on both the groups but the more students grow up, the more they pass on to
the fields/gym from the idiot box.

Lesson 5: Pastimes vary
A

Read the dialogue. What is it about? Do you agree or disagree

Tiya

: Anusha, I really wonder how pastimes vary from generation to
generation.

Anusha

: Oh yes. Do you know why?

Tiya

: I don’t know exactly. Maybe time is a big factor.

Anusha

: You are Right. Time changes many things. It changes our tastes and
abilities.

Technology has roles too. Look, there was a time when

playing in the fields was very popular because we had many open fields
around. Going to neighbour’s house or hanging out in groups were
popular pastimes as well. You won’t see these pictures now. The
process of urbanization, the satellite aggression, and people’s
dependence on technology have changed our lifestyle. Now boys and
girls of urban and semi-urban areas are more dependent on the
computer whether it is through social networking, video games, or
computer assisted programmes.
Tiya

: Right. But how do you know all these things, Anusha?

Anusha

: Oh….I read an interesting article on people’s changing pastimes. It
analyses the issue through a graph. Here it is. Read and you will enjoy
it, I guess.



30

English For Today

B

Read the article. Underline the words/expressions used in the
article to show the rise and fall of any data. The first one is done
for you in the text.

There is change in people’s trends towards favourite pastimes. A recent survey shows
that during the last twenty years, teenagers have gone through significant changes in
choosing their pastimes. The survey results are presented through a graph which
shows that there is a steady rise in young people’s tendency to watch TV. In 1990,
41% of teen agers liked watching TV which increased to 48% in the next ten years
and it further increased to 52% in the next decade. Unfortunately, the picture is grim
in terms of young people’s attraction to open field games and sports. When 50% of
youngsters opted for games and sports in the 90s, 12% withdrew themselves from it
after a decade making it 38%. Unfortunately the falling tendency persisted on during
the next ten years and by 2010 it came to 25%. Though the young people have
dissociated themselves noticeably from games and sports, there is a sharp and solid
increase in their association with online or computer assisted programmes. In 1990
when the users of online or computer for pastimes were only 9%, in 2000 the number



English For Today

31

nearly doubled and reached 14% with a rapid increase in the next ten years when it
shot up to 23%.
The survey also explains the reasons for this change. It says that television has
become a part of everyday life even to the underprivileged section of people. This
results in young people’s choice for watching TV as one of the most favourite
pastimes. The increasing urbanization has reduced the number of open fields.
Therefore, there is a fall in selecting games and sports as favourite pastimes, though
it’s not any good news for the country. And the reason of selecting the computer
assisted or online programmes is that computer technology is getting cheaper, easier,
and more popular every day. Indeed our young generations are stepping to an eworld.

May Day or International Workers Day is observed on May 1 all over the world
today to commemorate the historical struggle and sacrifices of the working people to
establish an eight-hour workday. It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of
the world.
Since the Industrial Revolution(1) in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US,
the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even
more hours a day.
On May 1st in 1886, inspired by the trade unions(2), half of the workers at the
McCormic Harvester Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour
workday. Two days later, a workers’ rally was held near the McCormic Hervester
Company and about 6000 workers had joined it. The rally was addressed by the
labour leaders. They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle
and not to give in to their bosses. Just at this moment some strikebreakers started


36

leaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back.
Suddenly about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers. One striker
was killed instantly, five or six others were seriously wounded and many of them
were badly injured.
The events of May 1, 1886 is a reminder that workers will continue to be exploited
until they stand up and speak out to gain better working conditions, better pay and
better lives.
Notes
1. Industrial Revolution: the period, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries Europe, when
machines were invented and first factories were established.
2. Trade Union: an organisation that represents workers of mills and factories.

Questions
1 What does May Day refer to?
2 How long did the workers have to work a day before the May 1 strike?
3 How many workers were victimised for taking part in the strike?

21 February is a memorable day in our national history. We observe the day every
year as International Mother Language Day. The day is a national holiday.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to establish
Bangla as a state language in undivided Pakistan in 1952. This is known as the
Language Movement.
The seed of the Language Movement was Sown on 21 March 1948 when
Mohammad Ali Zinnah, the then Governor General of Pakistan, at a public meeting
in Dhaka declared that Urdu would be the only official language of Pakistan. The
declaration raised a storm of protest in the eastern part of the country. The protest
continued non-stop, gathering momentum day by day. It turned into a movement and
reached its climax in 1952. The government outlawed all sorts of public meetings and
rallies to prevent it.
The students of Dhaka University defied the law and they brought out a peaceful
protest procession on 21 February 1952. When the procession reached near Dhaka
Medical College, the police opened fire on the students, killing Salam, Rafiq, Barkat
and Jabbar. This enkindled the sparks of independent movement of Bangladesh.

plying on the river. The boat could cross it in 8-10 minutes. It was just after sunset.
The weather was getting worse. The wind started blowing from the north-west. Black
clouds were fast-moving in the sky.
Everybody was trying to get into the boat. ‘No more, no more, please wait,’ shouted
the boatman. But nobody listened to him.”

“With too many people on board, the boat sank in the middle of the river,” replied

“In our last class, we heard Jamil’s story of how too many people made the ferry boat
sink. I have also seen crowds of people at the bus stand, railway station, launch and
steamer ghats. It is not uncommon to see people travelling on top of a bus or train
and meeting with tragic accidents. My question is: Are we really too many people in
the country?”
“Thank you, Shanti. Please sit down.”
The teacher then looked round the class and asked, “How many of you have the same
question in mind?”
Almost all the hands went up.
“Okay,” the teacher continued. “Finding the right answer to this question is very
important for us - for our national development. So we will look at this issue with
some facts so that we can find out if we are really too many or not.”

56

English For Today

The class comes up with different problems. One group leader says, “The scarcity of
food will be a serious problem. It is true that our agriculturists have developed new
varieties of rice and its per acre production has definitely increased. But the rate of
increase in food production cannot keep pace with the rate of population growth. This
is because our land is fixed, i.e. we cannot increase it, while our population is
increasing rapidly.”
Another group leader comes up with the housing problem in the country, which he
says adds much to the food problem. He continues, “Families are growing larger in
size and breaking into smaller families. Each such family needs a separate house to
live in. Also the arable fields are being divided by these smaller families among
themselves. Mills and factories are being set up, which occupy a considerable portion
of our land. So when we need more land to grow more food to feed more mouths, our
land is shrinking day by day. If our population grows at the present rate, a day will
come when many people will not find any land to build a house on. And, as a result,
many of them might live on trees or on the floating boats in the rivers.”
“No way,” another student argues. “Trees are being cut, hills are being cleared and
water bodies are being filled up --- all to meet the needs of too many people.”
“Thank you students,” Ms Choudhury says, “You’re quite right. Let me tell you
about this village where I was born and brought up. Things were not like this in the
past. I remember as a child, the village was so beautiful! The green paddy fields and
yellow mustard fields seemed to be unending. They used to wave and dance in the
breeze. There used to be a wood in the northern side of the village. There was a tall
tamarind tree in the middle of the wood. Also a big banyan tree looked like a huge
green umbrella, with its aerial roots hanging down. I often used to go there with my
age-mates. We would often have picnic there. While the boys would climb the
tamarind tree and pick some tamarinds, me and my best friend Rima used to swing

In the next class Ms Choudhury tells her students the story of Lipi. In brief the story
is like this:
The year before last, Lipi, a 14-year old girl, had been in class 9 in a rural school in
Rangpur. Lipi is the eldest of five children---three daughters and two sons. Their
father is a day labourer working on other people’s land and mother is a homemaker
and a part-time worker at other people’s houses. The parents, particularly the mother,
found it real difficult to raise five children on the small income the father could earn.
Perhaps that is why Lipi’s father wanted to marry her off. But Lipi was not ready to
accept what her parents wanted to impose on her. She wanted to pursue her
education. So long her mother stood by her, though secretly. But when her father
arranged her marriage with Tara Mia, the only son of a farmer in the same village,
she became a little upset. Tara Mia was a widower—illiterate, but well off. His father
had a few acres of arable land and was influential in the village. The marriage
seemed to be inevitable.
Question 1
Discuss in groups and agree upon an answer to this question:
What do you think Lipi should do? Why?
Lipi first talked with her classmates and then with the Headteacher, who was very
sympathetic to her. He called a meeting of the teachers and students of the school.
Also the school managing committee members, some respectable persons of the
village, Lipi’s and Tara Mia’s fathers attended the meeting. The Headteacher
explained in detail the serious consequences that would follow Lipi’s marriage. She
would be having children from her very early age --- 15 or 16. It would create
constant health hazards to her. Her education would stop. And on top of all, her
marriage against her will might shatter her future dream.



At one stage, Tara Mia’s father stood up and tried to argue, “You are all making
mistakes. Lipi would be very happy if she got married with Tara Mia. She would
have everything---money, clothes, home and status in the society. Why are you trying
to deprive her of this opportunity?”
But no, the big majority, who attended the meeting, supported the Headteacher.
Lipi’s marriage was called off. She is now studying at Carmichael College, Rangpur.

Question 2

If Lipi had married Tara Mia that time, …

“Today there are many jobs where you need English. This is because the world has
become smaller. Vast distances are shortened by speedy transport. We can talk to a
person thousands of kilometres away on the phone or the Internet. So we can
communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication
easier.
There are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate
with them, you cannot speak all the languages. So you need a common language that
you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common

language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador
or a Korean builder in one language —English.
English for us in Bangladesh is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we
are too many people in a small country. So if you learn English, you have the best
opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good
news for millions of our unemployed youths.”
“But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs, “ says
Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. “Could you please
tell us why?” Rumi asks.
“This is a very important question, Rumi. We should learn how to use English both
orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating
with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at
the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,” continues Miss
Choudhury. “Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workforce.”
“But where and how can we learn this kind of English, Miss?” asks Ratan. Ms
Choudhury says, “We can learn this communicative English both in and outside the
classroom. Side by side with your textbook, the radio, television, newspapers,
magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you. And
during our classroom activities, we’ll see how we can learn this English.”

Lesson 1: The greed of the roaring rivers
A

Read the following text and answer the questions.

Meherjan lives in a slum on the Sirajgonj Town Protection Embankment. Her
polythene roofed shelter looks like a cage. She is nearly 45 but looks more than her
age. In front of her shelter, she is
trying to make a fire to cook the
day’s only meal. Her weak hands
tremble as she adds some

fallen

leaves and straw to the fire. The
whispering wind from the river
Jamuna makes the fire unsteady.
The dancing of the flames reminds
Meherjan of the turmoil in her life.
Not long ago Meherjan had everything--- a family, cultivable land and cattle. The
erosion of the Jamuna consumed gradually all her landed property. It finally claimed
her last shelter during the last monsoon. It took the river only a day to demolish
Meher’s house, trees, vegetable garden and the bamboo bush. She had a happy family
once. Over the years, she lost her husband and her family to diseases that cruel
hunger and poverty brought to the family. Now, she is the only one left to live on
with the loss and the pain. The greedy Jamuna has shattered her dreams and
happiness.
There are thousand others waiting to share the same fate with Meherjan. Bangladesh
is a land of rivers that affect its people. Erosion is a harsh reality for the people living
along the river banks. During each monsoon many more villages are threatened by
the roaring of rivers like the Jamuna, the Padma and the Meghna. It is estimated that
river erosion makes at least 100,000 people homeless every year in Bangladesh. In


fact, river erosion is one of the main dangers caused by climate change. If we can’t
take prompt actions to adapt to climate change, there will be thousands of more
Meherjans in our towns and villages every year.

Now read the following passage to know more about environmental
pollution in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh is now apparently in the grip of all sorts of pollution like air pollution,
soil pollution and water pollution. The dwellers of the urban areas are the worst
sufferers of such pollution. The indiscriminate industrialisation process in
Bangladesh over the past decades has created significant environmental problems.
We will now know about some of the most common types of environmental
pollutions and ways of coping with them.
Air pollution
Air pollution comes from a wide variety of sources. In Bangladesh poisonous exhaust
from industrial plants, brick kilns, old or poorly-serviced vehicles and dust from
roads and construction sites are some of the major sources of air pollution.
We can reduce this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and
avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants
to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their
cars. The government may relocate hazardous industries like brick kilns to areas
away from human habitations.
Water pollution
Water pollution can occur in oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds and underground reservoirs.
As different water sources flow together, the pollution can spread easily and quickly.
Causes of water pollution include:
x increased sediment from soil
x erosion
x improper waste disposal and littering
x leakage of soil pollution into water supplies
x organic materials that decay in water supplies etc.


English For Today

71

In fact, polluting the land means polluting the water. Throwing away a toxic
substance on the ground near a water space means it eventually reaches a body of
water. As a result, the water is polluted. Industrial wastes must not be disposed in
rivers or lakes. We need to be more careful about disposing household wastes too.
Use of pesticides means that when it rains on the lawn or garden, chemicals wash
into the water bodies. Therefore, we must be aware of the dangers of using pesticides
as they may pollute our rivers, canals and lakes.
Soil pollution
Among the most significant causes of soil pollution is the enormous volume of
industrial waste which is being produced every day but not disposed properly. The
mismanagement of household wastes, particularly the polythene shopping bags, has
caused serious threat to the soil, and the drainage system. Another cause for soil
pollution is the use of agricultural pesticides, fertilizers etc. Sometimes fuel leakages
from automobiles may get washed away by rain and seep into the nearby soil.
Pesticides and fertilizers are useful for plant growth but their overuse has led to soil
pollution. Natural fertilizers and compost can be used instead of their chemical
alternatives. Recycling is another way to reduce and control soil pollution. Recycling
papers, plastics and other materials reduces the volume of refuse in landfills. Deforestation also causes erosion, pollution and the loss of fertility in the topsoil.
Planting trees and re-forestation help prevent soil erosion and pollution.

Do you agree with the following
statements on fish and fishing?
Discuss with your partner(s).
a

Fish will never disappear. There will always be enough fish to feed
the world.

b

In many ways, people are the same as fish.

c

The hobby of fishing should be banned to help protect fish
population.

C

Read the text below and say if the statements below are true/false. If
false,

give the correct information.

Fish population is in serious danger from global warming. Climate change is
increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less
food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and
may have fewer offspring. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise
even by one or two degrees.
Climate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the
world’s most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat
fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
we will increase the pressures on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will
suffer from hunger and

Lesson 5: A friend of the Earth
A

Discuss the questions in pairs.
1 Do you throw away empty cans and bottles?
2 What do you do with your old newspapers?
3 What happens to the garbage after you throw
it away?

B

Read the following text carefully to know
about how we can save our environment.

LET’S SAVE OUR PLANET!
Everyone must play a part in protecting the environment. There are many things you
can do on your own every day to help save the planet. Here are some suggestions.
REDUCE!
Really, the best thing we can do for the planet is to use less of it. Our consumer
society is mainly responsible for the environmental crisis. Here are some questions
you can ask yourself before buying something, “Do I really need this?” or “Is there
another product which would do the same thing but more sustainable?” Or ask the
question, “Will this last a long time?” Some other questions may be, “Do I know how
this item was made, how it will be used and how it will be disposed of?”
REUSE!
What do you think of using your own ceramic cup or mug at your school or local
club? It means there are no plastic cups to throw away. You can wash it and reuse it
every day. Unfortunately, we are encouraged to buy a new “improved” item even if
the one we have can be repaired or reused. When we buy things, we should buy items
which are durable; we should use them properly, and have them repaired when


English For Today

79

necessary. If we practise this, many things can not only last a life-time, but also be
passed on to future. However, If something is truly unusable for its original purposes,
try to be more creative and think of how else it might be used. When you’re done
with it, think of whether someone else might be able to use it. You can donate some
of the things to the poor. You may also sell some of your used items through personal
ads in a local newspaper.
RECYCLE!
Rather than throwing an item out when neither you nor anyone else can make use of
it, have it recycled. And while recycling is not possible, it is better to send goods to a
landfill or have them burned up. Find out what types of materials can be recycled in
your area. Clean and sort the materials before putting them out in the bin. Recycling
your drink and food cans means there will be less trash in a resource recovery facility
or landfill. Moreover, a company can use the old cans to make new ones.
C

Now ask and answer these questions in pairs.
1 How can you cut down your shopping list?
2 What can you do to reuse things.
3 What kind of household goods, clothes and toys, can be donated?
4 How can you sell your used items?
5 How recycling may help save our environment?

Hindu Kingdom in the world.
The Kingdom of Nepal is a
small land of sublime beauty.
It has some of the world’s best
and very important temples. It
is a country that is rich in scenic luxury and cultural treasures.
b Nepal lies between India and the Tibetan part of China. This small country has an

c Nepal is home to nearly 29,000,000 people. The population is primarily rural.
Kathmandu, the capital city, has less than one million inhabitants. Nepal's
demographic features are complicated not only by dozens of ethnic groups, but by
different castes. In total, there are 103 castes and ethnic groups living in this small
country. The two largest of such groups are known as Chetri and Bahun. Others
include Magar, Tharu and Tamang, Newar, Muslim, Gurung and Damai. About
48 percent of the people speak Nepali. Among other languages spoken are
Maithali, Bhojpuri, Tharu and Tamang.
d Nepal is the holy land of Lord Pashupatinath and Gautam Buddha where the
Hindus and Buddhists have lived together in harmony for centuries. The Temple
of Pashupatinath is the most sacred Hindu shrine and one of the four most
important cities in the world for Shiva worshippers. Lord Buddha, the light of
Asia, was born in Lumbini in Nepal’s southern plains, which makes this a scared
pilgrimage destination for the Buddhists as well. In fact, many Nepalese combine
Hindu and Buddhist practices; many temples and shrines are shared between the
two faiths, and some deities are worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists.


e The Kathmandu Valley is the rich cultural heritage centre of Nepal. The three
ancient cities of the Valley- Patan, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur- represent an
epitome of harmony in urban design, elegant architecture and refined culture.
These cities are famous for religious monuments unequalled in the world. The
seven monument zones situated within the Valley have been named as World
Heritage Sites by UNESCO.
f

Adding dazzling colour to Nepal’s vibrant culture are the many festivals that are
celebrated throughout the year. Dasain or dusherra is celebrated nationwide in
October. Thes is the most important of all Nepalese celebration and includes the
biggest animal sacrifice of the year. Tihar is celebrated in November. Other
festivals include the Holi and Chaitra Daisan. Some Hindu festivals are the

2 Which country is the world’s largest tea exporter?
3 Which country did the spice cinnamon originate from?
4 Which country was mentioned in the great Indian epic the Ramayana?
5 Which country has the highest literacy rate in South Asia?

B

Now read the following passage to find your answers to the questions in A.

a When someone comes to Sri Lanka, they may often hear the word Ayubowan.
This word means ‘May you have the gift of long life’. It is with this traditional
greeting that everyone is welcomed to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has many nicknames:
Serendip, Ceylon, Teardrop of India, Pearl of the Indian Ocean, etc. These names
reveal the richness and beauty of this island nation. Many travellers, from ancient
mariners and merchants to modern astronauts, have been attracted by the beauty
of this island.
b Sri Lanka is located in the Indian
Ocean, just off the south-eastern
coast of India. Shaped like a
teardrop, the island of Sri Lanka
measures about 415 kilometres
from north to south, and about 220
kilometres from east to west, with a
total land area of about 65,600
square kilometres. It has more than
1340 kilometres of coastline.

c Despite its modest size Sri Lanka has a
population of about 20 million. Sri Lanka is a

and Sri Lankan Moors or Muslims. A fifth
group,

the

the

original

inhabitants of the island. The ancient history
of Sri Lanka is depicted in the Hindu epic the
Ramayana. But the most important work on
Lankan origin is related in Mahavamsa or

Colombo: The capital city

‘The Great Chronicle’.
d Sri Lanka's economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. The emphasis is
on exporting crops such as tea, rubber, and coconuts. In fact, Sri Lanka is the
largest tea exporter of the world. The country is also a major producer and
supplier of a variety of spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, pepper, cloves, and
nutmeg. Cinnamon first originated in Sri Lanka and was introduced later to the
world by the Arab merchants.
e Sri Lanka's archaeological treasures reflect the civilizations of the past that
covered the golden age of Greece, the Roman Empire, Mayan citadels, and
Napoleonic greatness. The culture that followed those glorious pasts has been
enriched by the more recent influences of Western colonizers and Eastern traders.
That resulted in developing a unique mix of races and religions, arts and crafts,
festivals and costumes available in this small country.
f

Besides these man-made riches, one may find the God-given blessings of nature
in Sri Lanka. The island is blessed with azure seas, sandy beaches, green hills,
cascading waterfalls, abundant wildlife and a variety of flowers and fruits. The


country abounds with coconut groves, spice gardens, tea estates and many other

People have been living on the islands of the Maldives from as long as 3000 years
ago. They set sail from different parts of the world- Asia, Arabia, Europe and the
Americas- to come to these islands. The earliest settlers of the Maldives were
probably from southern India and Sri Lanka who came to these islands in the fourth
and fifth centuries BC. In the 12th century AD, sailors from East Africa and Arab
countries came to the Maldives. As a result, the Maldivians who were originally


Buddhists were converted to Sunni Islam in the mid-12th century. In 1344 Ibn
Batuta, a famous Arab historian and scholar travelled around the Maldives.
In the 16th century, the Portuguese conquered the Maldives and they ruled the
country for 15 years. Although governed as an independent Islamic sultanate for
most of its history from 1153 to 1968, the Maldives was a British colony from 1887
to 1965. Following independence from Britain in 1965, the sultanate continued to
operate for another 3 years. On November 11, 1968, it was abolished and replaced by
a republic and the country assumed its present name.
The Maldives is famous as a tourist destination because of its enjoyable weather,
heavenly beaches and lagoons, luxurious holiday resorts and the peace-loving people.
Being an island country, it enjoys a pleasant weather throughout the year.

The

Maldives has been ranked as the best country brand for beach, rest and relaxation in
2008. In the same year, it was also ranked second as the best country brand for
natural beauty.
The Maldives is well known for being the lowest country in the world.
Unfortunately, this small country with idyllic natural beauty is under threat from
rising sea levels due to global warming. Most of the country is just 1.5 metres above
sea level with a highest point of 2.3 metres! Many predictions have been made with
respect to Maldives being swept away by the rising water level in the Indian Ocean.
It was even seen during the tsunami of
2004, that many of the island's dry parts
were flooded by waters shrinking the
island. The government of the Maldives
has begun to purchase land from nearby
countries in case the islands go under
water!

India is our closet neighbour. It is the largest
among South Asian Countries. In fact, India is
the seventh largest country in the world with
an area of 3,287,590 square kilometres. India
is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the South,
the Arabian Sea on the West, and the Bay of

Bengal on the East. It is bordered by Pakistan to the West; China, Nepal, and Bhutan
to the North; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the East. India is the world’s second
most populous country after China. Its current population as in 2010 is around 1.15
billion. New Delhi is the capital of India and about 13 million people live in the
capital.
India is a land of ancient civilization. The social, economic, and cultural
configurations of this vast country are the products of a long process of regional
expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization and
the coming of the Aryans. During this period Aryan culture flourished in this part of
the world. The fifth century saw the unification of India under Ashoka, and it is in his
time that Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam came
to India for the first time and by the eleventh century it had firmly established itself.
It resulted into the formation of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 by Qutb ud din Aybek.
This was finally succeeded by the Mughal Empire in 1526, under which India once
again achieved a large measure of political unity.
It was in the 17th century that the Europeans came to India. This coincided with the
disintegration of the Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional states. In the
contest for supremacy, the English emerged as the 'victors'. In 1774 Warren Hastings
was appointed the first Governor General of India by the East India Company. In
1876 Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by the British parliament
and India came under the British rule completely. They ruled India for nearly two
hundred years.

This period was marked by India's struggle for independence.

Through a series of heroic and patriotic movements to restore freedom, India got its
independence in 1947.
The culture of India is one of the oldest and unique in the world. In India, there is
amazing cultural diversity throughout the country. The South, North, and Northeast
have their own distinct cultures and almost every state has carved out its own cultural


distinction. There is hardly any culture in the world that is as varied and unique as
India. There are 17 major languages and 844 dialects used by the people of India.
India is a tourists' delight. The Taj
Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, The Qutab
Minar and the Red Fort are a few of
the many wonders which attract
people from all over the world.
Kashmir has been described as a
paradise on earth. The country of

Lesson 5: Bhutan: The land of happiness

Read the following text and answer the questions.

Bhutan is called the Jewel of the
Eastern Himalayas. This small,
landlocked country is located
along the southern slopes of the
Himalayan range, bounded by
Tibet in the North and India from
the other sides. The official name
of Bhutan is Druk-yul which
means ‘land of

the

thunder

dragon’. It earned this name because of the fierce storms that often roll in from the


100

English For Today

Himalayas. The country has an area of 38,394 and a population of 716,896. Since it is
cut off from the rest of the world by the Great Himalayas, a unique culture and
tradition based on gentle Buddhist beliefs have evolved over time.
Bhutanese men wear Gho - a knee length robe - and women wear Kira - a sheet like
cloth piece. Bhutanese houses are built from mud and stone, with wooden shingle
roof. The Bhutanese never use iron nails in their buildings. Usually, the Bhutanese
build each other's houses by exchanging labour within the

community. Different

Festivals are celebrated all year round in Bhutan. The festivals

reflect

colourful

masks and the rich Bhutanese culture. Dances are performed by the Buddhist monks
to protect the valleys and ward off evil spirits. The main religious festival is called
Tshechus. The teachings of Lord Buddha are enacted through mask dances for threefive days in the courtyard of the monasteries. People attend these events in their best
clothes, with picnic baskets. Another major festival is called Losar. It is celebrated
on Lunar New Year. People cook special dishes and wear new clothes. It is a time
for family get together. Men play archery or darts while women sing and dance.
Pure mountain air, crystal blue skies and pristine vegetation cover have made this
small country an ideal destination for the environment lovers. The ecosystem of this
small nation supports the existence of rich flora and fauna which are protected by
strict laws. Even, anyone found guilty of
killing a black-necked crane could be
sentenced to life in prison.
The government of Bhutan has taken a
number of steps to protect its biodiversity. Bhutan is the first country in the
world

with

specific

constitutional

obligations on its people to protect the

environment. As per the constitution, at least 60 percent of the country must remain
under forest cover at all times. Efforts are also taken to protect the nation against the
intrusion of foreign cultures and values. The first foreign tourists were allowed into
Bhutan in 1974. Now, tourism is encouraged but is controlled and limited to about
6,000 visitors a year. Bhutan is one of the last countries in the world to introduce
television and the Internet to its people. The government lifted a ban on TV and the
Internet only in 1999. The Bhutanese government has made it mandatory for all
Bhutanese to wear only their national dress in public.
Finally, the most interesting fact about Bhutan is that they are the only country that
measures success in Gross National Happiness rather than Gross National Product! In
2006, Business Week rated Bhutan as the happiest country in Asia and the eighth
happiest country in the world.

Lesson 1: Zainul Abedin, the great artist
A

Read the text and answer the questions that follow.

The pioneer of Bangladeshi modern art Zainul Abedin
is widely acclaimed for his Bengal ‘Famine Sketches’.
Through a series of sketches, Zainul not only
documented the harsh famine of 1940 but also showed
its sinister face through the skeletal figures of the
people destined to die of starvation in a man-made
plight. He depicted these extremely shocking pictures
with human compassion. He made his own ink by
burning charcoal and using cheap ordinary packing
paper for sketching. He produced a series of brush and
ink drawings, which later became iconic images of human sufferings.
Zainul developed a knack for drawing and painting when he was a high school
student. After completing high school, he got admission to the Government School of
Art, Calcutta (now Kolkata). He graduated with the first position in first class in
1938. He was appointed teacher of the Art School while he was still a student there.
He also attended the Slade School of Arts, London in 1951-52.
Zainul Abedin is considered the founding father of Bangladeshi art. He was an artist
of outstanding talent and earned international reputation. For his artistic and
visionary qualities, he is referred to as Shilpacharya meaning ‘great teacher of art’ in
Bangladesh. He was the first Principal of the first art school in Dhaka in East
Pakistan (now Bangladesh). He organized the Nabanna (harvest) exhibition in 1969.
In the exhibition, a 65-foot long scroll portraying the rural East Pakistan in phases
from abundance to poverty. This intensified the already heightened non-cooperation
movement against the Pakistan regime. The exhibition was symbolic of the artists’
protest and a milestone in demanding cultural and political freedom. Zainul’s


English For Today

105

dynamic style of work is evident in a 30 foot long scroll painting called Manpura,
which was done to commemorate the death of hundreds and thousands of people in
the devastating cyclone of 1970.
He designed the pages of Constitution of Bangladesh. He founded the Folk Art
Museum at Sonargoan, and also Zainul Abedin Shangrahasala, a gallery of his own
works in Mymensing in 1975.
The river Brahmaputra plays a predominant role in his paintings and a source of
inspiration all through his career. Much of his childhood was spent near the scenic
beauty of the river Brahmaputra. A series of water colours that Zainul did as his
tribute to the river earned him the Governor’s Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition
in 1938. This was the first time when he came into spotlight and this award gave him
the confidence to create his own visual style.
Zainul was born in Kishoreganj on 29 December 1914 and died on 28 May 1976.

In the primitive age communications took place between humans through signs and
gestures. As humans began to use their vocal chords, these silent gestures were no
longer used as the primary means of communication. But they did not completely
disappear. They evolved as a form of art, used to entertain thousands, and came to be
known as ‘mime’.
Mime touched a little boy’s heart while he was watching a performance in his
village. He was so fascinated by the show that he was determined to master this art.
He is no other than Partha Pratim Majumder, who won the world’s highest award in
mime- Moliere Award.


English For Today

109

Partha is undoubtedly a forerunner in the field of mime in Bangladesh. He started as
a musician and his keen sense of rhythm helped him to let his limbs move and
express his surroundings through gestures.
Partha Pratim Majumder is the first Bangladeshi to take up mime as a profession. He
performed in a number of television shows in Bangladesh and gained popularity. In
his mime, Majumder depicted the day-to-day life of the people. There was sadness,
tears as well as happiness and laughter.
Majumder’s turning point of life came in 1979, when he was asked to give a solo
performance in Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. The then French ambassador Loic
Moreau happened to be among the audience. Mr. Moreau noticed the talent in
Majumder. In 1981, the French Government offered him a scholarship so that he
could get professional training in mime. This was the first time that a student was
granted a French scholarship in mime. Majumder started his training under the
legendry maestro, Etiene Decroux. Through Decroux, he met another celebrated
mime artist named Marcel Marceau. Marceau has transformed modern mime by
taking it to an unimaginable height.
Marceau was very impressed by the Bangladeshi young talent and offered him a
place in his school for mime, named ‘Ecole Internationale de Mimodrame de ParisMarcel Marceau’. This school is the biggest and the best in the world.
During his three years training period, Majumder practiced 16-18 hours daily till
each and every bone in his body would feel like breaking.
After his time with Marceau, there was no looking back for Majumder. He staged
solo performances in England, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy and the USA. French,
Canadian and American TV channels enthusiastically aired his shows.

Partha Pratim Majumder was born in 1954 in Pabna to a family of artistes. He spent
most of his early years in his ancestral home, one of the biggest houses, situated in a
small locality known as Kalachandpara. At that time Kalachandpara was well known
for its cultural activities. There were festivals and various types of cultural shows
round the year. Majumder’s father, a photographer by profession was an art lover. He
taught and inspired his son to appreciate different forms of art.
Majumder went to live with his aunt in Chandernagar, 30 kilometres away from
Kolkata in 1966. It was there that he first came across a mime artiste named Jogesh
Dutta. The way Dutta narrated stories without uttering a single word, left Majumder

It was Autumn. August 26, 1910. A little girl was born to an Albanian descent, rich
Catholic merchant’s family in a small town called Skopje, Macedonia. She was the
youngest of the three siblings and was named Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Who had
known that this tiny, little girl would one day become the servant of humanity-- love
and serve the poorest of the poor and become the mother of humanity. Yes, we are
talking about none other than Mother Teresa.
At the age of 12, she heard a voice from within her that urged her to spread the love
of Christ. She decided that she would be a missionary. At the age of 18 she left her
parental home. She then joined an Irish community of nuns called the Sisters of
Loreto, which had missions in India.
After a few months of training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin,
Mother Teresa came to India. On May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun.
From 1931 to 1948, Mother Teresa taught geography and catechism (religious
instruction) at St. Mary's High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). However, the
prevailing poverty in Kolkata had a deep impact on Mother Teresa's mind, and in

Mother Teresa was moved by the presence of the sick and dying on the streets of
Kolkata. She founded the home for the dying destitute and named it ‘Nirmal Hridoy’,
meaning ‘Pure Heart’. She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people off the
streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after


and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets
and carried to Nirmol Hridoy. T hese unloved and uncared for people get an
opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get
human and Divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who
survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes
where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding
commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, “ Maybe in our own family, we have
somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried. Are we
there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we
put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also
remember that future of humanity passes through the family”.
Mother Teresa's work has been recognised throughout the world and she has received
a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the
Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace & Understanding (1972), the
Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna (1980).
Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997.The world salutes her for
her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand
towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and
religion. Draped in a white and blue-bordered sari, wrinkled face, ever soft eyes and
a saintly smile, is the picture of Mother Teresa in our mind.

Read about Steve Jobs.

Steven Paul Jobs ( 24 February 1955 – 5 October 2011) , most popularly known as
Steve Jobs was the co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Apple Inc. He
was the pioneer of the personal computer revolution. He was famous for his career in
the electronic field of computers and consumers. This became possible through the
marketing of Apple computers.
In 1985, Jobs left Apple after losing a power battle with the board of directors. He
then founded NeXT, a computer platform development company specializing in the
higher education and business market. On the other hand, Apple failed to bring up
any new operating system during Job’s absence. Jobs returned to Apple as an adviser,
and took control of the company as an interim CEO. By 1998, Jobs brought back
Apple to profitability from the verge of bankruptcy. He supervised the development
of iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone and iPad. These devices are so simple and user
friendly that even a child can operate them.
He supervised the company’s Apple
Stores, iTunes Store and the App
Store too. The success of these
products and services brought about
steady financial returns for several
years and pushed Apple to become
the world’s most valuable publicly
traded

company

in

This

triumph is regarded as the greatest turnarounds in the business history.

internet connection) in laptops. It is who made Wi-Fi a standard feature of every
laptop, and of many other devices worldwide. So Jobs’ dream to be anywhere
anytime became a reality.

Lesson 8: Jobs’ childhood
A

Read the text and write answer the questions that follow.

A car mechanic Paul Jobs and his wife Clara jobs adopted Steve Jobs. Steve was
abandoned at birth. Paul and Clara loved Steve very much. They made him feel that
he was ‘chosen’ and very ‘special’.
One of his colleagues, Del Yocam said about Steve, “I think his desire for complete
control of whatever he makes derives directly from his personality and the fact that
he was abandoned at birth.”
Jobs’ mother taught him how to read and write before he went to the elementary
school. So when he went to school, he found out that he knew everything that the
teachers were teaching. He got bored and played pranks to keep him busy. This
continued for the first few years. It was clear from his behaviour that he could not
accept other people’s authority. He said, “I encountered authority of different kind
that I have never encountered before, and I did not like it.”
A turning point came when he was in grade four. His teacher Imogene Hill watched
him very closely for some time and soon found out how to handle him and get things
done by him. In order to get things done she used to give him money and food. One
day after school, she gave Jobs a workbook with math problems in it. She said, “ I
want you to take it home and do this.” She showed Jobs a huge lollipop and said, “
When you are done with it, if you get it mostly right, I will give you this and five
dollars.” Within two days, Jobs solved the math and returned the book to his teacher.
This continued for a couple of months and Jobs enjoyed learning so much that he did
not need any return. Also he liked his teacher very much and wanted to please her. In
Ms. Hill’s class, Jobs felt he was special. At the end of the fourth grade, Jobs did
very well. It was clear not only to Jobs and his parents but also to the teachers that he
was exceptionally intelligent. The school proposed that Jobs should skip two classes


and go into seventh grade. This would mean that Jobs would find the study
challenging and he would be motivated to study. His parents had him skip only one
grade.

‘Heritage’ is what we inherit from the past, live with them in the present and then
pass on to our children or future generation. Our unique source of life and inspiration
is our cultural and natural heritage. When we speak of ‘World Heritage’, it indicates
places and sites that we got from the past and pass on to the future generation of the
entire world.
The ‘Shat Gambuj Mosque’ in Bagerhat is such a heritage. It became a UNESCO
World Heritage Site in 1985.
Originally, the historic Mosque City was known as ‘ Khalifatabad’. It is situated at
the outskirts of Bagerhat town--- not very far from the dense mangrove forest of the
Sundarbans. Khalifatabad was a Muslim colony. It was founded by the Turkish
general, a saint warrior Ulugh Khan Jahan in the 15th century. The infrastructure of
the city reveals significant technical skills in many mosques as well as early Islamic
monuments. Baked bricks are used for the construction of the buildings. The
planning of the city is distinctly dominated by Islamic architecture and the
decorations are a combination of Mughal and Turkish architecture.


126

English For Today

Khan Jahan built a network of roads, bridges, public buildings and reservoirs to make
the city habitable. There are about 360 mosques in the city. Among them the most
remarkable is the multi-domed Shat Gombuj Mosque. The mosque is unique in the
sense that it has 60 pillars that support the roof, with 77 low height domes. The 4
towers at 4 corners have smaller domes on the roof as well. The vast prayer hall has
11 arched doorways on the east and 7 each on the north and south for light and
ventilation. It has 7 aisles running along the length of the mosque and 11 deep curves
between the slender stone columns. These columns support the curving arches
created by the domes. The thickness of the arches is 6 feet and have slightly
narrowing hollow and round wall.
The west wall in the interior has 11 ‘mihrabs’ (niche in mosque pointing towards
Makkah). These mihrabs are decorated with stonework and terracotta. The floor of
the mosque is made of brick.
Besides being used as a prayer hall, Khan Jahan used the mosque as his court also.
Today, it is one of the greatest tourist attractions and one of the best architectural
beauties of Bangladesh.

Lesson 2: The Somapura Mahavihara
A

Read the text.

Paharpur is an important archaeological site situated in a village named ‘Paharpur’ in
Naogaon district of northern Bangladesh. Naogoan is mainly plain land but in the middle
of it stood a hill covered with jungle. When the jungle was cleared and the hill
excavated, there emerged a lofty ruin of an ancient temple. The temple is about 24 metre
high from the surrounding level. ‘Pahar’ means hill. Hence is the name Paharpur.
The Paharpur site has been excavated and re-excavated a number of times by
archaeologists. Sir Alexander visited the place in 1879. Cunningham intended to
carry out an extensive excavation but was prevented by the land owner. Nevertheless,
he was satisfied with whatever excavation he was permitted to carry on. He
discovered the ruins of a square tower of 22 feet side with a projection in the middle
of each side from the top of the central hill. The site was declared to be protected by
the Archaeological Survey of India in 1919 under the Ancient Monuments
Preservation Act of 1904.


128

English For Today

Systematic and regular excavation started jointly by Archaeological Survey of India, and
Varendra Research Society of Rajshahi and Kolkata ( at that time known as Calcutta)
University in 1923. They excavated the south-west corner of the monastery. Next in
1925-26, R D Banerjee excavated the northern part of the central mound. From 1926-27
onward excavation was carried out under the supervision of KN Dikshit.
The Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh brought the site under further
excavation after independence. The operations took place in two phases. The first
phase was initiated in 1981-82 and continued to 1984-1985. The second phase was
started in 1988-89 and continued to 1990-91.
Pre-liberation expeditions have revealed the architectural remains of a vast Buddhist
monastery, the Somapura Mahavihara. It is dominated by the central shrine,
attracting immediate attention by its lofty height and unusual architectural design.
Somapura Mahavihara was one of the most famous Buddhist institutions for monks
of ancient Bengal and in southern Asia. The excavated complex at Paharpur has been
identified with the Somapura Mahavihara built by the second Pala king Dharmapala
(781-821 AD). Some clay seals from the ruins bear the inscription Shri-SomapureShri-Dharmapaladeva-Mahavihariyarya-bhiksu-sangghasya.

The Pala rulers were devout Buddhists and they founded a number of monasteries
throughout their growing empire. Some of them became great centres of learning and
their reputation quickly spread throughout Asia. Somapura Mahavihara's close
relationship with the ruling dynasty implied that it shared the political ups and downs
of its benefactors.

The French Sculptor Fredic Auguste Bartholdi was assigned to design and complete a
sculpture within 1876, so that it could be a gift for the Americans on the occasion of
celebrating the hundred years of the American Declaration of Independence. The
statue was a joint venture between the USA and France. The French people would
build the statue and assemble it in the States, and the people of the USA were to build
the pedestal for the statue.


132

English For Today

Raising money for the pedestal was completed in August 1885. The construction of
the pedestal was finished in April 1886. In the meantime, France completed the
Statue in July 1884. They sent it to New York on board the French war ship ‘Isere’ in
1885. While transporting the statue, it was split up into 350 individual pieces and
packed in 214 crates.
It took four months to put the Statue together and place it on the pedestal. Thousands
of people saw the unveiling ceremony of the Statue of Liberty on October 28th 1886.
It was centennial gift ten years late.
The Freedom that the Statue stands for is not stationary. The broken chain wrapped
around her feet, protruding from the bottom of her robe, symbolizes her free forward
movement, enlightening the world with her torch, free from oppression and slavery.
The Statue's original torch was the first part constructed in 1876. It was replaced by
a new copper torch covered in 24K gold leaf in 1984. The torch is lighted by flood
light at night. The original torch is currently located in the lobby of the monument.
Access to the torch has been closed since 1916.
From October 28, 2011, on her 125th anniversary, the Statue of Liberty was named
“Liberty Enlightening the World Wide Web”. The credit goes to a series of new web
cams placed around her torch. Several amazing views will be just a click of a mouse
away. On clear days, three cameras provide unobstructed scenes and views. Two
cameras provide an ultra wide-angle interactive view of the famous golden torch.
The remaining camera looks downwards towards the crown of The Statue of liberty,

Lake Baikal is the deepest and one of the biggest and most ancient lakes of the world.
It is situated almost in the centre of Asia. Lake Baikal is a gigantic bowl set 445
meter above sea level. This grand, enormous, unusual and charming miracle of
nature is located in the south of Eastern Siberia, in the Buryat Autonomous Republic
and region of Irkutsk, Russia.
The lake covers 31,500 sq.km. It is 636 km long and an average of 48 km wide. The
widest point of the lake is 79.4 km. The water basin occupies 557,000 sq. km. and
contains 23,000 cu.km.(cubic kilometer) of water, which is about one fifth of the
world’s reserves fresh surface water.


134

English For Today

The average water level in the lake is never higher than 456m. The average depth of
Lake Baikal is 730 m., and its maximum depth in the middle is 1,620 m. It would
take about one year for all the rivers of the world to fill Baikal’s basin, and would
take four hundred years for all the rivers, streams and brooks now flowing into
Siberian lake-sea to do the same.
There are hot springs in the surrounding area of Lake Baikal. The quality of the water
of these springs is excellent. The lake acts as a powerful generator and bio filter
producing this water. Baikal is a stormy lake. Autumn is the most stormy time. The
wind blows various directions.
The weather depends on the wind. If it is blowing from the north, the weather is
bright and sunny. The water of the lake looks green and dark blue. But if the winds
get stronger, Baikal turns black, waves rising high with white crest. The beauty of
Lake Baikal is exceptional.

Many of us think that we must have a
steady big job to be happy in life. Is that
always true? Look at the picture and
discuss in pairs what you see in it.

B

Read the text. It is about a young entrepreneur, Sayeed Kamal. Notice
what he thinks about job and happiness. Then answer the questions that
follow.

I know you will wonder if I say the best thing that ever happened to me was when I
lost my last job. Yes, really!
I was a desk clerk in an office. But believe me I never liked my job. Nothing can be
more boring than being stuck in an office all day with computers and telephone.
So after two years or so, I decided to leave my job though I had good salary there.
Now I’m an owner of a nursery. Planting seeds, budding, grafting, taking care of
saplings, cleaning the flower beds and spending time with trees are my full time job.
I start work very early. In summer I usually leave home at 5:30 in the morning, but in
winter not until about 7. I’ve a small hut in my nursery. There cannot be any more
pleasure for me when I see the moon from there or walk through the trees in the soft
moonlit night. The winter is just over. So I’m cleaning up the winter flower garden.
Now I’m busy in producing more timber and medicinal plants which people will buy
from July. Every season is so different and I love them all. When I compare my
present days with the past, I simply can’t understand how I could survive there in my



138

previous job. I love nature. I just love working outside in the open air after all those
months in a stuffy office. Gadgets never attract me and perhaps will never.
I’m not married. I do my own work even cook my own food. I try not to depend on
others for the work which I myself can do. Often my friends are annoyed with me.
They say, I should engage a maid for household chores. They are not happy to see me
in this ‘rustic life’. They are professionals. They earn a lot. Maybe --- much more
than me but I think I enjoy my work more.
At weekends, I often go countryside. Sometimes with my friends, sometimes alone. I
love collecting unknown saplings. I have another hobby. I love collecting stamps. I
have a Russian stamp during the period of Lenin. I don’t watch TV. Almost everyone
has a TV set these days. But I don’t have any. How is that?
The only problem I face is I do not earn enough money in all seasons. The winter and
the rain are two busy seasons for me. But it’s OK. Maybe I do not earn enough like
many other people around me. But I at least earn enough for my family, employees,
and me to run a decent life. I must say I’m a very happy man!

Questions
1 What is the best thing that ever happened to this man?
2 Why does Kamal like his job?
3 What is the problem with his job?
4 When does he earn most money?
5 What attitude do you find here in Kamal when you read these lines ‘Maybe I

enough for my family, employees, and me to run a decent life’?

ocean? These are all wacky, odd, unexpected, wild, crazy, unconventional, strange or
just plain weird jobs and careers. They are not your traditional career choices, but
somebody out there does all these things, gets paid for it, and enjoys life like
anybody else.
There are hundreds of such jobs to take if you want to travel the less taken ways of
life. You have to decide on several questions:
x What companies will recruit/hire me?
x Do I actually make a paycheck?
x What type of education/diploma will I need?
x Can I make a living doing this?
Your answers to these questions will help pave your career roadmap and help you
decide if you are ready to take the challenge. Decide if you want a change. A lot of
strange jobs also allow you to work part-time or freelance when it fits your schedule.
This way you can get a taste of freedom, a secondary income, and build experience at
the same time.
Do you have interests beyond writing memos and attending boring meetings? If so,
you may wonder how you can find a strange job. Hobbies are a good place to start.
What do you do for fun? Do you stuff animals, act like Charlie Chaplin, or make
model cars? If you enjoy it, someone out there works in that field and is making
money off your hobby. Maybe they are testing mountaineering equipment,
developing fragrances, trying new brands of undergarments, or saving sea turtles.
And they are getting paid good wages.
Questions
1 ‘But have you ever thought of other types of jobs out there----?’ What does the
author mean by ‘other types of jobs’?

Read the text and answer the following questions.

Have you ever thought of a very delicate career? Have you dreamt of a rosy
environment full of colour and fragrance? How much would you love it if you were
placed in a house full of flowers to deal all day? I’m just going to give you some
clues for a way of business, a job.
Yes. Daises, violets, tulips, marigolds, dahlias, bellies, jasmines, roses and all those
things of beauty can also earn you a living if you handle them professionally. In fact,
a florist’s career is rather a good choice as an unconventional job for many around
the world. Wherever you see eye-catching floral displays, you actually see the
professional performance of a floral designer. They are also known as florists and
they create superb arrangements with flowers. Using both real and artificial flowers
with other greeneries, florists prepare flower displays for a variety of events such as
weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, marriage days, Valentine’s day, official
receptions and even funerals. Every flower is with its distinct colour, design,
significance and meaning which flower designers have to know well. There are
conventions and significance associated with flowers. We know that conventionally
roses are meant for romance and anniversaries and tulips for birthdays.
Although formal education or a diploma is not always essential, florists must have a
good taste, good eye for colours, shapes and proportion. They have to have good


English For Today

145

sense for selecting flowers, ribbons and other accessories to make beautiful
arrangements. Professional florists are knowledgeable about not only flowers but also
designs and techniques. Most florists learn the trade mainly through apprenticeship in
a previous flower farming job and also by attending formal floral schools and
courses. However, a true passion for flowers and a bit of aesthetic sense are all that
can make a florist’s career successful.
Flower designers earn fairly handsome money. But the bonus is that they belong to a
fresh fun job. They work in flowers all day long in a nice atmosphere with fresh air,
pleasant smells and vivid colours around. But there is a disadvantage too, if you are
inclined to see so. Florists deal with flowers, but miss their honey!
Questions
1 How is the career of a florist?
2 What qualities do you need to have for a florist’s job?
3 How does most florists learn the trade?
4 What is the extra advantage of a florist’s job?

D

Suppose you have met a florist in a flower shop. Write an imaginary
interview with him/her.

E

Write a short paragraph giving reasons why you like or dislike the job of
a florist.

Pritilata was born in Chittagong on 5 May 1911. She
was a meritorious student at Dr Khastagir Government
Girls’ School in Chittagong and Eden College, Dhaka.
She finally graduated in philosophy with distinction
from Bathune College in Kolkata. In her college days,
Pritilata was an activist in the anti British movement.
All through her life, she dreamt of two things: a society
without gender discrimination, and her motherland

without British colonial rule. So she received combat training to fight against the
British rule. Soon after, Pritilata became the headteacher of Nandankanon Aparna
Charan School in Chittagong. Gradually she involved herself in Surya Sen’s armed
resistance movement. Surya Sen was a famous anti-British movement organizer and
activist in Cittagong area that time.
In 1932, Surya Sen planned an
attack on the Pahartali European
Club. The club was well-known for
its notorious sign Dogs and Indians
not allowed. Surya Sen assigned

Zahir Raihan was one of the most talented film
makers in Bangladesh. He was born on 19 August
1935 in the village Majupur, in Feni district. He
was an active worker of the Language Movement.
He was one of the ten students to go out in a
procession on 21 February 1952 despite a ban on
such activities. As a result, he and many others
were arrested and taken to prison. Zahir was also
present at the historical meeting of Amtala on
February 21, 1952. He also took part in the mass
movement in 1969. In 1971, he joined the
Liberation War.




English For Today

155

All through his life, Zahir dreamt for a democratic society, a society that will ensure
freedom of speech and will. He had many dreams about our film industry too. He
made a legendary film Jibon Theke Neya based on the Language Movement of 1952.
It was a revolt against the then autocratic government. The family presented in that
film was a miniature East Pakistan ruled by an autocrat who had to go to the prison
for her conspiracy. During the liberation war this film was shown outside
Bangladesh. Critics like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak appreciated this
film. Zahir gave all his money to the Freedom Fighters’ trust that he got from his film
shows. Besides, his great documentary on Pakistani atrocities, Stop Genocide, helped
create world sentiment in favour of our liberation war.
On 30 December 1971, someone informed Zahir about an address somewhere at
Mirpur, where he might find his brother, the famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser.
Shahidulla was captured and killed by the Pakistani army and the local collaborators
during the last days of the war. Accordingly Zahir left home to get his brother back
and he never returned. Zahir’s dream was fulfilled. He could see the inception of a
free independent Bangladesh though he did not get back his brother. And it’s a pity
that this dreamer was missing at such a time when his dream came true.

Sohan lives in a village in the south-west part of Bangladesh. Last night he could not
sleep. His sister had the SSC exam next morning. She could not read either. There
was-load shedding. The summer night being sticky hot, life became hell without
electricity. Most of their area remained dark for hours due to power shortage.
In May-June, temperature shoots up to 40 degree Celsius. With almost 90 per cent of
humidity in the atmosphere, it becomes all sweat, wet, damp and stinky. When you
are busy fanning yourself all the time, how come you concentrate on studies? In the
night it is impossible to sit in the study with a candle light or table lamp or hurricane
lamp or a rural kerosene lamp. People simply come out of houses almost bare-bodied
and sit in the open places. Some splash cold water on their faces. Fans are still, lamps
are out and it is dark everywhere. It is simply unbearable.
What is the reason of frequent load-shedding? Press reports say there is a shortage in
electricity production. According to the Power development authorities, the demand
for electricity a few years ago was more than 6,000 MW* a day while the supply
remained around 4,200 MW. In the rural areas, the Rural Electrification Board (REB)
could supply barely half of the total demand which was around 2,400 MW per day.
In the capital city, the demand stood at around 1,400 MW while the supply amounted
to 650 MW. As a result, load-shedding is unavoidable for the time being. But
situation is improving very fast.
*MW is Mega Watt which is the unit to measure electricity

Read the text and answer the following questions.

In a speech at the 90th Science
Congress,

internationally

acknowledged

scientist

and

former Indian president Mr
APJ Abdul Kalam mentioned a
very

important

aspect

of

mankind’s future energy crisis.
He pointed out that the era of
wood and bio-mass has almost
come to an end. The age of oil
and natural gas would soon be over within the next few decades. Massive burning of
world’s coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster because coal
burning emits the highest amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Ukraine’s (former
Soviet Union) Chernobyl disaster in 1986 has exposed that nuclear energy can be
potentially dangerous too. So according to Kalam, the only solution that mankind can
look to is the massive use of solar energy in future because it has some advantages
over other forms of renewable energies.
Now why has Kalam put so much importance to the issue of energy? The energy
sources have always been a major factor of change throughout history. The world’s
petroleum consumption has increased from annually 3 billion barrels in 1930 to
annually 50 billion barrels today. In the next quarter century, the world’s population
is expected to be about 8 billion which is 30 percent higher than today. Developing
countries will grow their economies about two times faster than industrialised
countries. Global economic growth is expected to continue at 3 percent per year.
Consequently, the global demand for energy will grow at about 1.7 percent per year
on an average. It indicates a 50 percent rise of energy consumption by 2030. If the
world’s daily petroleum consumption is 220 million barrels now, it will rise to 335


million barrels by that time. The present reserve of hydro-carbon energy resources is
limited and it will not be sufficient to meet the future energy challenges of the world.
And hence, leading industrial countries have taken initiatives to tap alternative
energy sources mainly known as green or renewable energy sources. The bottom line
of Kalam’s speech indicates that concern of mankind in the 21st the century.

Chairman

: What’s your alternative power supply system?

Mr Islam

: Well, it’s actually solar power units that we are going to use in rural
areas.

Chairman

: What’s it? Is it something new?

Mr Islam

: Not exactly. It’s already familiar in many parts of the world. We’ve
introduced it in our country too. But yes, in this area it’s something
new.

Chairman

: I see. Why do you call it ‘alternative power supply system’?

Mr Islam

: Solar power is actually a renewable energy source. Our solar units
can be installed on open roof tops or at any open place where sunlight
is available. It can be a substitute to conventional electricity.

Chairman

: Sounds good. How much electricity can they give? Can they run my
irrigation pump?

Mr Islam

: I’m afraid Mr Chairman, they can’t. Our solar panels are small and
are designed for domestic purposes only. They can produce enough
electricity to run say, two or three tube lights, two fans, a TV set and
the like. But larger units can run…

Chairman

: Sorry to interrupt Mr Asad. I’ve to go to the bus stand now to receive
my sick friend. Anyway, several villages in our Union are still
without electricity. I hope people will welcome your ‘alternative
power supply system’.

Mr Islam

: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Goodbye.

Chairman

: Goodbye, Mr Asad. See you again.

B

Read the text and answer the following questions.

Countries of the world rely heavily on petroleum, coal and natural gas for their
energy sources. There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and nonrenewable. Hydro-carbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy.
Reliance on them poses real big problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas etc,
are finite energy resources and the world eventually will run out of them. Secondly,
they will become too expensive in the coming decades and too damaging for the


English For Today

167

environment to repair. Thirdly, fossil fuels have direct polluting impacts on earth’s
environment causing global warming. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as,
wind and solar energy are constantly and naturally replenished and never run out.
Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or
solar energy can be used for heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity
and for other commercial and industrial uses.
The sun’s heat drives the wind and this wind energy can be captured with wind
turbines to produce electricity. Then the wind and the sun’s heat cause water to
evaporate. When this water vapour turns into rain or snow and flows downhill into
rivers or streams, its energy can be captured as hydroelectric energy.
Along with the rain and snow, sunlight causes plants to grow. Plants produce
biomass which again can be turned into fuels such as fire wood, alcohol, etc
identified as bioenergy.
Scientists have identified Hydrogen as another form of renewable energy source. It is
the most abundant element in nature. But it does not exist separately as a gas. It is
always combined with other elements, such as with oxygen to make water.
Hydrogen, separated from another element, can be burned as a fuel to produce
electricity.
Our Earth’s interior contains molten lava with tremendous heat. This heat inside the
Earth produces steam and hot water which can be tapped as geothermal energy to
produce electricity, for heating home, etc.
Ocean energy comes from several sources. Ocean’s force of tide and wave can be
used to produce energy. The surface of the ocean gets more heat from the sun than
the ocean depths. This temperature difference can be used as energy source too.

their Eid?

B

Read the following text.

Eid is the main religious festival of the Muslims in Bangladeh. Eid means happiness.
Eveyone wants to share this happiness with their near and dear ones. So most of the
people, who are living outside their home for different reasons have a strong desire to
get back home during the Eid vacations. As a result, there is a mad rush in the buses,
trains, or launches for the home-bound people. This often causes transport accidents
that take away many lives. However, it cannot stop people’s desire to meet their
family, in-laws, or friends. What makes people rush for their homes in spite of
serious hazards? This is the pull of the roots. Do human beings have roots like the


English For Today

173

trees? The answer is ‘yes’ but unlike the roots of the trees they are invisible, they lie
in our minds. It’s these roots that make a bond between us and family members, inlaws, friends, neighbours or even between us and the land where we were born and
grew up. In that sense our families, land of birth, relatives, our culture, traditions, or
surroundings are our roots. And whereever we stay, we have a continuous pull of our
roots. It’s our roots that develop our identity making us what we are. When we lose
that bond, we become rootless. Human beings who do not have any root or contexts,
are non entity. In other words, they do not have their own identity. Such persons are
devoid of values, humanity, and social responsibilities. They don’t know where they
are from, and/or where they are heading towards. This often makes them feel empty
and lost.

Mainul Islam is a qualified farmer in Naogaon. Mr Islam was very brilliant as a
student. He took his higher education from Bangladesh Agricultural University in
Mymensingh. After completing his higher education Mainul came back home and
started advanced farming. He has two other brothers who are graduates in different
areas. The specialty of the Islam family is that they all are living in their village and
all have fame in their own fields. His younger brother, who is a Rajshahi University
graduate, is a science teacher in a local school. His youngest brother is a social
science graduate and he too would like to start a local NGO to work for this area.
When asked “What makes you decide to stay here in this village?”, Mr Islam smiled.
He said, “Look, it’s true that we could leave this village for a city life. I could be an
officer or my brother could be a bureaucrat. But it didn’t attract us. We are sons of
this soil. Yes, we have education but does education prepare a person only to be an
officer? Don’t we have any obligation to the soil that has made us what we are?” He
also added that every educated individual shouldn’t be a job seeker. He continued
that since his discipline was Agriculture, after his education he took the occupation of
a farmer. In response to the question whether they have any frustrations to live in a
village, he confirmed that they were very pleased with their life. He said, “I work in

my own farm, stay with my family members, pass time with my old friends, and
sleep at my own home. All these count a lot.”
Mr Islam is right. Many people go to cities and forget or loosen their roots knowingly

Lesson 3: The return of the native
A

Read the following text.

Michael Madhusudan Dutt was a popular 19th-century Bengali poet and dramatist.
He was born in Sagordari on the bank of the Kopotaksho River, a village in
Keshobpur Upozila under Jessore district.
From an early age, Dutt aspired to be an Englishman in
form and manner. Though he was born in a sophisticated
Hindu family, he took Christianity as a young man, much
to the ire of his family, and adopted the first name Michael.
In his childhood, he was recognised by his teachers as a
precious child with a gift of literary talent. His early
exposure to English education and European literature at
home and his college inspired him to imitate the English in
taste, manners and intellect.
Since his adolescence he started believing that he was born
on the wrong side of the planet, and that his society was unable to appreciate his
intellect. He also believed that the West would be more receptive to his creative
genius. Michael was an ardent follower of the famous English poet Lord Byron. So
after adopting Christianity, he went to Europe and started composing poetry and
drama almost entirely in English. They proved his higher level of intellectual ability.
However, he failed to gain the right appreciation. With his utter frustrations he saw
that he was not regarded as a native writer of English literature. Out of his frustration
he composed a sonnet in Bangla “Kopotaksha Nad”, which earned him huge
reputation in Bangla. Gradually he could realise that his true identity lies here in this
Bengal and he was a sojourner in Europe. Afterwards he regretted his attraction for
England and the Occident. He came to Bengal and devoted himself to Bangla
literature from this period. He is the poet to write the first Bangla epic Meghand
Badh Kabya.

Often I’m so sorry to see the footpaths occupied by floating people. They are living in
some makeshift houses. I simply cannot think how father, mother grandfather,
grandmother and kids are living in such a tiny place. Within few yards in their possession
they are sleeping, socialising, cooking and even beautifying themselves. These people are

living in such an inhuman condition! This cannot be the picture of life in a civilized
society. Also they are polluting the area. They are the least bothered about their health and
hygiene. Out of my curiosity, I talked to some of these people. They have their own home
and identity at their own village. They are here thinking that the city life will make their
life better. What an irony! Can’t the society or the state do anything for these people?
However, I must admit that I’m amazed to see how they sometimes tidy up the place
especially in the evening!! Home, sweet home after all !
Mithun
Dear Mithun
I understand your concern. Human flow from the rural areas to the urban areas is a big
social problem in many countries like ours. These floating people are definitely a burden
to the cities where they migrate. When the number is huge, it is difficult for any state to
rehabilitate them quickly. See from the other side. The people you have referred to have
lost their roots and they are unable to assimilate in the new culture. Maybe many of them
are attracted by the gloss of the cities, but I’m sure it was a need to many others. People
become rootless sometimes due to climate change, river erosion, social discrepancies, or
poverty. However, you cannot solve this problem overnight. But you can take steps to
improve their lifestyle. Why don’t you form a committee with other young people in your
locality that will teach them basic health, hygiene, and ethics? It may better their life as
well as help you minimize pollution. Give it a try.

English For Today

An e-mail is an electronic mail. It is a computer-aided way of exchanging digital text
messages from a sender to one or multiple recipient/s. Emails operate through a
network of computers linked by the Internet. There are commercial server agencies
such as Yahoo, Gmail, Ymail, Hotmail, etc. that accept the text message from the
sender, forward it and deliver instantly to the digital mailbox of the recipient. If the
recipient is not online, the message is stored and delivered later when the recipient is
online. It works instantly just with the click of your mouse. It has been a powerful
communication tool in modern life.

Read the text and answer the following questions.

The advantages of the Internet technology have made it possible to emerge a good
number of web sites to facilitate social relations among people around the world.
These are known as social networking services or social networks. At present,
Facebook is the most popular. Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. are other frequently
used social services. Social network services are web-based and hence, provide ways
for the users to interact through the Internet. These services make it possible to
connect people sharing interests and activities across the borders and thus have made
a lot for the users to feel that they really live in a global village.
Why are social networks expanding so fast? The answer is simple. Most of the social
l services are cost free. You can make use of them free, paying a very little to your
Internet service provider. Secondly, you can make your personal profile public before
the entire online community. It is like presenting yourself before the entire world.
You can also look into other people’s profile if you are interested. It is simple and
easy. Thirdly, social networks allow users to upload pictures, multimedia contents
and modify the profile. Some like Facebook allow users to update their profiles.
Fourthly, networks allow users to post blog entries. User profiles have a section
dedicated to comments from friends and other users. Finally, there are privacy
protection measures too. A user himself or herself decides over the number of
visitors/viewers, and what information should be shared with others.
Questions
1 What do you mean by social networks?
2 What are some uses of social networks?
3 ‘These services …have made a lot for the users to feel that they really live in a
global village’. Do you agree with this view? Why/ Why not?

Work in pairs. Discuss the following questions.
x Have you ever experienced any digital education programmes in multimedia
or CD/DVD?
x Have you ever used any digitized educational resources such as Oxford
Dictionary, Banglapdedia and IELTS/TOEFL practice materials?
x Have you ever heard of any online education course?
x Have you ever seen a classroom teaching programme on TV?

C

Read the text and answer the following questions.

Can you think of a classroom where there is no blackboard or desks? Do you believe
that you can be a student without a traditional book or writing pad or even
pen/pencil? Are you not thrilled to imagine that you have asked a question and your
tutor is answering that while flying midair in a Boeing from California to Tokyo?
These are all possible in a ‘virtual campus’ in the system of e-learning. No kidding!
For quite a long time, educationists have been utilizing the advantages of computer
technology. The social networking services have a huge potential to help
educationists in this sector. They have access to millions of people worldwide.
Educationists have noticed that a large number of social network users come from
young generation and especially belong to student community. So side by side with
computer assisted teaching-learning software, online education programmes are
evolving fairly rapidly to assist conventional education system. But is that elearning?
We may confuse distant education or computer-based learning or computer-assisted
training or even online education programmes with e-learning. But we should be
cautious about the mix-up. What happens in an online education programme? Maybe
you get some materials online from your tutor. Maybe you submit your assignment
through email. Or even you may take your test online. But there must be some
conventional campus, a department/institute from where your certificate will come.

But in e-learning, as said by global e-learning guru Dr Badrul H Khan*, every step
such as, registration, admission, classroom entry and exit, class work, attendance,
discussion with course mates, feedback, exams and finally certification must take
place electronically through computer and the Internet technology in a virtual
campus. Everything is digitized and conducted by a system called Learning
Management System (LMS). So online education programmes blend various
components of e-learning.
The revolutionary concept of e-learning is already in its practice phase in many parts
of the world. Professor Khan has developed a framework and important literatures on
e-learning which have been praised by pundits worldwide including Bangladesh.
Professor Khan is especially enthusiastic about the prospect of e-learning in
Bangladesh.
How would you feel if Bangladesh contemplates South Asia’s first virtual university?
Won’t it be a pioneering step for us in the world of e-learning? Let’s keep our
fingers crossed.

University and the University of Texas, USA. He is one of the celebrated theorists in the field of
e-learning.

Books
What worlds of wonder are our books!
As one opens them and looks,
New ideas and people rise
In our fancies and our eyes.
The room we sit in melts away,
And we find ourselves at play
With someone who, before the end,
May become our chosen friend.
Or we sail along the page,
To some other land or age.
Here’s our body in the chair,
But our mind is out there.
Each book is a magic box,
Which with a touch a child unlocks.
In between their outside covers,
Books hold all things for their lovers.

Lesson 2: Two Mothers Remembered

A

Read the poem and answer the following questions
Two Mothers Remembered
I had two Mothers – two Mothers I claim
Two different people, yet with the same name.
Two separate women, diverse by design,
But I loved them both because they were mine.
The first was the Mother who carried me here,
Gave birth and nurtured and launched my career.
She was the one whose features I bear,
Complete with the facial expressions I wear.
She gave her love, which follows me yet,
Along with the examples in life she set.
As I got older, she somehow younger grew,
And we’d laugh as just Mothers and daughters do.
But then came the time that her mind clouded so,
And I sensed that the Mother I knew would soon go.
So quickly she changed and turned into the other,
A stranger who dressed in the clothes of my Mother.
Oh, she looked the same, at least at arm’s length,
But now she was the child and I was her strength.
We’d come full circle, we women three,


My mother the first, the second and me.
And if my own children should come to a day,
When a new Mother comes and the old goes away,
I’d ask of them nothing that I didn’t do.
Love both of your Mothers as both loved you.

And call the cattle home,
And call the cattle home,
Across the sands of Dee!”
The western wind was wild and dank with foam,
And all alone went she.
The western tide crept up along the sand,
And o’er and o’er the sand,
And round and round the sand,
As far as eye could see.
The rolling mist came down and hid the land
And never came home she.
“Oh! Is it weed, or fish, or floating hair—
A tress of golden hair,
A drowned maiden’s hair,
Above the nets at sea?
Was never salmon yet that shone so fair
Among the stakes of Dee.’
They rowed her in across the rolling foam.
The cruel, crawling foam,
The cruel, hungry foam,
To her grave beside the sea:
But still the boatman hear her call the cattle home
Across the sands of Dee.

His house is in the village though;

To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistakes.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to before I sleep.

Rosamond, a little girl about seven years old, was walking with her mother in

to stop to look at them and buy them all, without knowing their uses or even
without knowing their names.

At first they stopped at a milliner’s shop. The windows of the shop were
decorated with ribbons, lace and festoons of artificial flowers.
“Oh, Mamma, what beautiful roses! Won’t you buy some of them?”
“No, my dear.”
“Why?”
“Because I don’t want them. They are not real flowers.”
They went a little further and came to a jeweller’s shop. In it were a great
many pretty, bright ornaments of little value, set beautifully behind the glass.
“Mamma, will you buy some of these?”
“Which of them, Rosamond?”
“Which? I don’t know which. Look at those earrings,
that necklace, those pendants! Any of them will do,
they are so pretty!”
“Yes, they are all pretty, but of what use would
they be to me?”
“I am sure, Mamma, you could find some use
if you only bought them first.”
“But I would rather find out the use first.”
Though a little disheartened, Rosamond kept on looking at the shops and
persuaded her mother to buy this or that.
“Mamma, buckles are very useful things. Please buy some.”
“I have a pair of buckles. I don’t need any now.” So saying her mother walked
on.

This time Rosamond was really disappointed as her mother wanted nothing.
However, while they were passing by a chemist’s shop, she saw some jars--blue, green, red, yellow and purple---and she seemed to have a fascination for
a purple jar. But her mother answered as before, “Of what use would they be
to me, Rosamond?”
Oh, Mamma, I would use it for a flower pot.’
“But you have a flower pot and the jar you are dying for buying is not a flower
pot.”
“Yet, Mamma, I like it so much …!”
Then suddenly she cried, “Ouch! A stone, mamma, a stone has got in my shoe.
It hurts!”
“Oh! How did it get there?”
“See, there’s a hole in my shoe, Mamma. In fact, my shoes are quite worn out.
Would you be so good as to buy me another pair?”
“But, Rosamond, I haven’t got money enough to buy shoes, jars, jewellary,
buckles and all that you wish to buy.”

Rosamond became sad again. Her mind flashed back to all those beautiful
things she had seen that morning.
“But, Mamma, I like the purple jar very much. And now my foot hurts. Could
you buy me only these two things --- the jar and a pair of shoes, please?”
“No, Rosamond, you can buy only one thing. However, you may buy the other
thing next month. And you have to decide which one you would like to buy
now.’
“I need the shoes badly,” Rosamond began to argue with herself, but my heart
is in that beautiful jar.”
Then looking at her shoes, she told her mother, “These shoes are not so bad,
except for the hole in one. I think I can make them last till the end of the
month, can’t I? Don’t you think so, Mamma?”
“I want you to think for yourself, dear.”
“Okay, if you please, I would like to have the purple jar.’
“Very well, you will have it.”

shoe, and she often limped with pain.

211

When they got back to the shop, Rosamond’s mother asked her to carefully examine
the jar before she bought it. But Rosamond was so excited that she bought it even
without looking at what was inside the jar.
Happily she came back home with her mother. Then Rosamond quickly brought some
flowers from the garden and was going to put them into the jar. But as soon as she took the
top off, she saw something dark inside, which gave off an unpleasant smell.
“What is it, Mamma? I didn’t want this black thing and the terrible smell.”
“Nor did I, my dear.”
“But what shall I do with it?”
“That I can’t tell.”
“Okay, Mamma, I must pour it out and fill the jar with fresh water.”
Then she made the jar empty. But to her great disappointment, she found that it was
no longer a purple jar --- it was a plain white glass jar. With its coloured water gone,
the jar did no longer look beautiful.
Rosamond cried with tears of disappointment in her eyes. She was to cry more for
her folly. Every day her shoes grew worse and worse, and she could neither run,
dance, jump, nor go shopping with her mother.
Thus Rosamond suffered for a whole month and learned a lesson the hard way. She
hoped that she would be wiser in future.

Once upon a time in Venice, there was a very rich merchant named Antonio. He had
many ships, that sailed in the sea. His ships carried different types of merchandise to
other countries. He sold those goods in foreign countries. He bought spices and other
valuables with the money and sold them in Venice.
Antonio was a good and kind man. He always helped the poor. The people of
Venice loved him very much for his honesty and kindness.
Antonio had a close friend named Bassanio. He was a handsome young man and was
born in a noble family. Bassanio like to lived a very luxurious life. He loved grandeur
and style. He spent more money than his earning. As a result, he was very often short
of money. In such situations, Bassanio would go to his best friend Antonio for help.
Antonio would, on the other hand, help him with cash.
It so happened that, Bassanio fell in love with a wealthy lady named Portia. Portia
was known not only for her beauty but also for her wisdom. Portia, on the other hand,
had softness towards Bassanio too. He wanted to visit Portia in a grand manner but
he did not have any money. So he went to Antonio.
Bassanio said, “ Dear friend Antonio, I am in great need of some money. I would like
to visit Portia at Belmont, grandly dressed and with many servants. But I don’t have
any money right now. Please help me to fulfill my intention.”
Antonio said, “ This is not a problem my friend, how much do you need?”

“ Three thousand ducats (Venetian currency) will do.”
“ I don’t have that much money with me now as all my ships have gone out in the sea with
merchandise. But don’t worry my friend, I’ll arrange three thousand ducats for you.”
So he decided to borrow the sum from a moneylender named Shylock. Shylock was
a very crooked man. Antonio and
Shylock hated each other.

Shylock

sued to lend money with high interest.
He would even send the debtor to
prison if he failed to pay his debt. On
the contrary, Antonio used to lend
money to help those who need it and
would not charge any interest.
Shylock agreed to lend him money but on one condition. If he failed to repay the
money in three month’s time then he has to pay a penalty. Shylock would cut a
pound of flesh from any part of Antonio’s body.
Antonio willingly agreed thinking that his ships would soon return with all the rich
merchandise and he can easily return the money to Shylock by selling them. Shylock
made Antonio sign a bond before giving him the money. Antonio took the money
and gave it to Bassanio.

Read the text and answer the following questions.

Bassanio went to Belmont to visit Portia grandly dressed, with many servants.
Portia’s father had died lately. Before his death he had thought of an unusual plan to
find a good husband for his daughter. He wanted a man to marry Portia for herself
and not for her wealth. He had three caskets made, one of gold, one of silver and one
of lead. One of the caskets had Portia’s portrait in it. The suitor, who would first
choose the casket with the portrait would marry her. Many suitors went away when
they heard about such a strange condition.
The first one to try was the prince of Morocco. He thought that silver and lead are
poor metals. It is the casket made of precious metal that can hold the precious
picture. So he chose the gold casket. But all he found was a picture of a skull with a


216

message that said, “All that glitters is not gold.” The prince was very sad and went
back home. Then came the prince of Spain. He looked at the silver casket for a long
time. On it was written,

“ He who chooses me will get what he deserves.” The

prince had a very high opinion about himself. He thought that he deserved the best.
He therefore chose the silver casket and opened it. Inside the casket he found the
picture of a blinking fool. He was very disappointed and offended. He immediately
rode away.
Then it was Bassanio’s turn. He looked at the caskets for a long time. He thought, “
Appearances are often misleading. Bad men appear good and they hide their inner
ugliness under fine clothes.” So he chose the plain looking lead casket. On opening
the casket, he found the portrait of Portia inside.
Bassanio and Portia got married. There was great joy
at Belmont and the newly married couple were
spending their time happily.
But soon their happiness turned into sorrow by a piece of
news. A messenger came with a letter from Antonio.
The letter said, “ Dear friend Bassanio, all my ships have
been lost at sea. I cannot pay the money I owe to
Shylock. So I have to pay the penalty. Dear friend, come
and see me if possible. I would like to see you once
before I die.” Bassanio quickly left for Venice.

Lesson 11: The trial
A

Read the text and answer the following questions.

When Bassanio reached Venice, Antonio was already in the court of justice. They
were waiting for the trial to begin. The Duke entered the courtroom, took his seat and
the trial began. The Duke requested Shylock to be merciful and not to claim his
pound of flesh. But Shylock would not listen to him. Bassanio offered him twice the
amount of money that Shylock lent Antonio but Shylock did not accept it. He said, “
I claim my pound of flesh. The law is on my side. Antonio must pay the penalty
written in the bond.”
The Duke was extremely sorry that he could do nothing g to help Antonio. The law
was on Shylock’s side and the law must be abided. The Duke feared that though the
wisest lawyer in Venice was coming to speak in defense of Antonio, even he would
not be able to save the merchant. Soon a young clerk entered the courtroom with a
letter from the wise lawyer. The lawyer was ill and would not be able to come to the
court. He requested the Duke to let his young friend, Doctor Balthazar, defend
Antonio. The Duke gave his permission, and Doctor Balthazar entered the courtroom.
He looked very young, and the Duke doubted if the wisdom of the young lawyer
could save Antonio. This young lawyer was no other than Portia in disguise and the
young clerk was her friend, who was also in disguise.
Portia begged Shylock to be merciful and told him how God bestows mercy to those
who are merciful themselves.



218

“ Mercy” Portia said, “ brings a blessing to him who shows it and to him who
receives it. All of us pray to God for mercy. But God will only have mercy on us if
we have mercy on others.”
Shylock paid no heed to Portia. All he wanted was his pound of flesh.
Portia asked, “ Can’t Antonio pay the debt?”
Bassanio cried, “ Yes, he can pay it, and even more. … Even I can pay ten times the
sum my friend borrowed from Shylock.
“ Won’t you take the money, Shylock?” Portia asked.
“ No, I demand the lawful penalty. Give me my pound of flesh.”
“ Let me see the bond Shylock”, said Portia.

Shylock handed the bond to her. She read it with great attention and then said, “ You
are right Shylock. The law is on your side. You can claim the flesh. But I would
request you one more time to accept the sum Bassanio is offering you, and let me tear
up the bond.” But Shylock would not give up his claim. Portia then turned towards
Antonio and said, “ Get ready Antonio for Shylock to cut his pound of flesh. The law
gives it to him.”
Shylock was filled with joy on hearing what Portia said. He began to praise Portia in
disguise, for her wisdom and righteousness. He cried out, “Oh noble judge! Oh
excellent young man, you are a second Daniel, who has come to this earth.”
Portia urged Shylock to cut the pound of
flesh he demanded. Delighted, Shylock
walked towards Antonio with a knife in
hand. He told Antonio to uncover his chest.
But as he was about to cut Antonio’s flesh,
Portia stopped him. She cried out, “ Wait
Shylock! Never forget - there is no mention

of blood in the bond. Therefore, you cannot shed a single drop of blood while you cut your
pound of flesh; or else you pay the penalty. And the penalty is, the state will take your
property from you. You lose everything that you have now, Shylock.”
Shylock understood it was not possible for him to cut a pound of flesh without
shedding blood. He was defeated by the wise lawyer. He hung his head and without
another word left the courtroom. Thus Antonio’s life was saved.

I was a custom-house officer in 1827. At that time there was much smuggling
in this country. There were government officials to check this unlawful trade,
but many of them were bribed to hear and see nothing. It is, therefore, not
surprising that many captures slipped through our fingers.
I was then a young man. For some years of good work, I had been raised to
the rank of a riding officer with a good salary that enabled me to marry.
My station was on the South Coast near the town of Dover. In those days,
most of the sailors along the coast took part in smuggling. On several
occasions when I did my duty properly, I received warnings from the wellknown townsmen that I was too active to carry out my duties. But I did not
want to be a silent, toothless watchdoglike old Captain Peabody who had for
forty years looked with blind eyes after the rights of the country. My chiefs
had always praised me as I was very honest and dutiful. They were already
talking of raising my rank further.
Once in a stormy autumn night, I successfully led my team to a secret place
where the smuggled goods were stored. The hiding place was a cave forty feet
below the surface of a chalk- hill in the south of England.

After this capture my Chief came to Dover to report on it. He praised me and

threatening letters of the smugglers.

One dark December afternoon, a letter, but of a different nature, arrived. It was
stamped with ‘On His Majesty’s Service’. The letter was written by one of my chiefs.
It informed me that, according to secret news they had received, a great cargo was
going to be landed that very night on the coast between Dover and Folkstone. I was
told to go to a particular place of the cliff exactly at eleven o’clock that very night.
There the chief and his men would wait for me. He wanted to use my knowledge and
experience to catch the smugglers. Also he ordered me to come alone and not to
speak of his letter or the meeting place to any person in Dover.

All that evening while I was preparing for my night ride, Lucy was looking at me sadly. I
was oiling and loading my guns, getting ready my sword and belt, my heavy coat and high
boots. And all the time she was looking at me with her blue tearful eyes.
“Are you quite sure,” she asked, “that the letter is in the Chief’s handwriting?” I
laughed at her, but she wanted an answer. I had to admit that I did not know his
official handwriting. However, I assured her that he had been newly appointed and he
must have good intention to protect our national interest from the smugglers. Still
Lucy was doubtful.
I tried to cheer her up by talking to the bright future awaiting us after tonight’s expedition. I
told Lucy that after the capture I am sure I would be rewarded with a rise and a position in
the London main Custom House. I talked of a nice cottage at Islington, with a garden, and of
the best school for our son Alex. Lucy tried to smile but all in vain.
After supper when I began to set out, Lucy trembled in fear and said, “Alfred, dear,
are you quite, quite sure that the letter really came from your Chief?” I laughed, told
her not to be afraid, and hurried out of the room and walked down the street.

I took my lonely way up the high cliffs. It was all dark and miserable. I was trying to keep
up my cheerful spirits. But Lucy’s last question, “Are you quite, quite sure that the letter
really came from your Chief?” kept coming back again and again to my mind.
I knew the meeting place. It was a large cliff standing above the angry sea. I walked
slowly up and down along the cliff edge. It was all dark and quiet except for the
mysterious sound of the waves. A trembling ran through me.
Soon I heard the low voice of some men, coming from the hillside. I thought they were the
Chief and his party. So I hastened up to them and said, “Good evening, gentlemen!”
But there was no answer. After a sharp and clear whistle, I was seized by a dozen
strong hands at once. So sudden was the attack that before I could strike a blow or
pull out my sword, I was pinned to the ground and disarmed. The smugglers!
“We’ve got the fellow at last!” cried several voices at once. Then followed a stream of
curses, “Murder him!” “Cut him into pieces and through him to the fishes!” And so on.
“Stop!” cried out the voice of one who no doubt was their leader. “First make sure
he’s the man we want.”
My hands were now safely bound, and all resistance was impossible. A red light
flashed full on my face.

“He’s the fellow we want!” They all cried. By the light of the lamp, I could see that
all those strong built men were in sailor’s clothes. They were all armed, their faces
being covered.
Then I was mercilessly beaten and knocked down. Someone put a gun at my head.
“Stop!” cried the leader. “Shooting is too easy a death for a man like him. Hang him over
the cliff.” There were roars of laughter, mixed with “Yes! Yes!” Then the leader said, “All
right, but before we do that, let’s here if he has anything to say in his defence.”

With despair in my heart I said, “I have done nothing but my duty to the King
without fear.” All was in vain, as the smugglers were too angry to listen to me.
Then came the ultimate verdict from the leader, “Alfred Harvey, you are a very tough
customs officer. Your punishment cannot be anything less than death.” Then he
turned to his men. “So tie him to the neck and heels, and throw him to the fishes.”
I made a great effort to break the ropes on my wrists, but they were too strong to
break. The men led me to the edge of the tall cliff, beneath which roared the sea.

Read the last part of the story and answer the following questions.
I was swinging half over the cliff and the men were preparing to throw me
below to my inevitable death.
“One! … “Two!” …
“Poor Lucy! God guard my wife and child!” broke from my lips half
unknowingly as I was going to die.
Those last words of mine had produced an effect which no fine speech or
begging for mercy could have produced. I was sure some of them had wives
and children of their own that they loved. My prayer had touched something in
their wild hearts that made them pause.
“Three!”
But nothing happened.
“I’ll have nothing to do with this,” said one man.
“His pretty blue-eyed wife is kind to the poor, my old mother once said,”
whispered another smuggler.
“Are you all chicken-hearted, men,” shouted the leader angrily.
Yet nothing happened. Quiet for some time they were whispering something
to their leader.

“Alfred Harvey,” said the leader, “we are going to give you a chance. Instead
of throwing you to the fishes, we shall hang you over the edge of the cliff, and
leave you there.”
The smugglers then lifted me over the edge and lowered me until my chin just
rested on the grass. I was asked to take a hold of the earth with my hands still
tied together.
They left me there to die. While I was hanging thus over my wide-open grave,
my thoughts flew off to Lucy and little Alex, to the pain and suffering that
were waiting for them.
I could no longer hold on. My strength was gone. I let go my hold.
But no! I did not fall into mid-air, did not crash on the rocks. And I did not
die! My feet sank only a few inches, and then touched the ground! It was no
dream! I fainted and fell to the earth.
When I came to life again, it was morning. I was lying on the wet ground. Two
men were beside me. The covering had been removed from my eyes, and my
wrists were free. I looked up, wondering whether I was in this world or the next.
“I’m very glad, sir, you’ve opened your eyes at last,” said one of the men. I
looked wildly about. I was not on the shore. No cliff rose up beside me. I was
lying just in a hole in the chalk hills. The hole was shallow, less than nine feet
in depth.
